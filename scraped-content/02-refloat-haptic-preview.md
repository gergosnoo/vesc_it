## Overview

The initial post announces a feature preview build of Refloat 1.1 focused on experimental haptic feedback implementation. As stated, "The goal of Feature Previews is to allow anyone who's interested to test and provide feedback on new features."

## Key Technical Details

The release contains more configuration options than the final version will include. The developer emphasizes this is "experimental software" and advises installation only at users' own risk.

## What's Included

- Experimental haptic feedback system
- Multiple configuration parameters for customization
- More settings than the eventual stable release

## Configuration Approach

The developer seeks community feedback on specific aspects:
- Which Float 2.0 haptic buzz patterns work best
- Whether users prefer audible or vibrating feedback
- Frequency preferences
- Whether tones should alternate or play simultaneously

## Known Challenges

- Certain frequencies interfering with the IMU sensor
- Need to balance customizability against "config option bloat"

## Feedback Request

Users testing the preview are encouraged to share working configuration values, particularly regarding frequency selections and strength parameters that perform well on their specific board setups.

The feature remains under development as of the thread's final entries in April 2025.
