## Overview

Field-Oriented Control (FOC) parameter ranges for electric motors used in personal electric vehicles. As noted: "If your motor detects slightly outside of this range, don't be too concerned, these are just the common expected values."

## Complete Motor Parameters Table

| Motor | Resistance (mΩ) | Inductance (µH) | Flux Linkage |
|-------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Phub188 | 85.0–110.5 | 115.0–138.0 | 22.5–23.5 |
| SF-MK1 (Superflux MK1) | 27.0–35.1 | 105.0–136.0 | 23.5–24.5 |
| SF-HT (Superflux HT) | 45.0–58.5 | 175.0–210.0 | 29.0–30.0 |
| SF-HS (Superflux HS) | 33.0–42.9 | 120.0–144.0 | 25.0–26.0 |
| CC-V1 (Cannon Core V1) | 90.0–117.0 | 190.0–228.0 | 36.8–37.8 |
| CC-V2 (Cannon Core V2) | 65.0–84.5 | 130.0–156.0 | 29.5–30.5 |
| Hypercore | 80.0–104.0 | 190.0–228.0 | 26.5–27.5 |
| Hypercore N42 | 80.0–104.0 | 190.0–228.0 | 27.5–28.5 |
| Hypercore N48 | 80.0–104.0 | 190.0–228.0 | 28.0–29.0 |
| Hypercore N52 | 80.0–104.0 | 190.0–228.0 | 28.0–29.0 |

## Notes

- Values are **expected ranges** from motor detection
- If your motor detects slightly outside these ranges, it's usually fine
- Resistance in milliohms (mΩ)
- Inductance in microhenries (µH)
- Flux linkage is unitless scaling factor
